                <p>I am a <strong>Gas Turbines Control Engineer</strong> professional who is passionate about technology, control theory and web technologies. In order to be able to play in different control systems, I have learned to develop control theory so that I can deploy it in different control platforms; therefore, becoming platform independent. I value honest and strong partnerships and collaboration. I am an open minded person and I am always looking forward to develop myself technically and as a person as much as developing those around me together in the process. I enjoy developing control software for gas turbines, be it using MarkVIe, RX3i, Micronet, Netmation, T3000 control platforms, you name it. In my current role I really enjoy the openness and range of different possibilities we have to tackle our challenges. Undoubtedly though, I really love to see the software I help creating to spin up the turbine's shaft and produce huge amounts of energy to the power grid!</p>
                <p>In my time out of the office I am a <strong>web developer geek</strong>. I am fascinated with the power of web technologies to bring people, resources and machines together. At this field I am also able to play with different stacks, both at the front and back end development. I am certainly looking forward for our interconnected future and the revolution that the Internet of Things are probably going to bring. I hope to be part of those helping shaping that change and bringing a better future for generations to come.</p>
